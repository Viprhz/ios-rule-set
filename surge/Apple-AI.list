# Purpose: Apple Intelligence / Siri / Assistant related domains and process hints

# Notes:
#  - This list is focused on Apple Intelligence (Siri/assistant/search/location/relay).
#  - Recommend to put this RULE-SET high in your [Rule] order so Apple AI flows hit it before generic Google/Streaming rules.
#  - Map the list to your AI proxy policy group (example: "🤖 AI-Service").
